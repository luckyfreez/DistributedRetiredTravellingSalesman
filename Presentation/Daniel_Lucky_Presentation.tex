\section{``Retired'' TSP}

\subsection{Traveling Salesman Problem}

\begin{frame}
\begin{Problem}[Traveling Salesman Problem]
Given a list of cities and their pairwise distances, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the
starting city?
\end{Problem}

\begin{itemize}
    \item One of the most studied problems in all of computer science.
    \item Decision version (does there exist such a cycle with cost $\le B$) is NP-complete\footnote{Recall from CS 256: NP-complete means (1) in NP
and (2) NP-hard.}.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
Our problem is harder!
\begin{Problem}[Distributed Retired TSP]
We have the following (real-world) problem:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A list of cities $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$
    \item A starting date $d_{start}$ and ending date $d_{end}$.
\end{itemize}
The goal is to find \textbf{the minimum cost} of any a series of flights $f_1, \ldots, f_m$ such that we visit every city \textbf{at least once}.
Hence, ``Retired'' TSP because you'd need to be wealthy and retired, and ``Distributed'' because we plan on using multiple machines to speed up
algorithm. 
\end{Problem}
\pause
Biggest challenge: for any two cities, costs are no longer fixed! 
\end{frame}


\section{Binary Integer Programming Formulation}

\subsection{Binary Integer Programming}

\begin{frame}
We use \textbf{binary integer programming} to help us solve Retired TSP.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\text{minimize }   \mathbf{c}^\mathrm{T} \mathbf{x} $
    \item $\text{subject to } A \mathbf{x} \ge \mathbf{b},$
    \item $\text{and } x_i \in \{0,1\}$
\end{itemize}

\pause
Here is how we formulated Retired TSP as a binary IP problem:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Let $c_{ijt}$ denote the \emph{minimum cost} of flying from city $i$ to $j$ on day $t$.
\end{itemize}
Our key variables:
\[
x_{ijt} = \begin{cases}
1 &\mbox{if we go from cities } i \mbox{ to } j \mbox{ on day } t, \\ 
0 & \mbox{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\]
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
Here are our first three constraints:

\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{ijt} \le 1 \mbox{ for all } t \in \{1, 2, \ldots, m\}.
\end{equation}

Ensures we have at most one flight per day.

\pause
\begin{equation}
\sum_{t=1}^{m} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{ijt} \ge 1 \mbox{ for all } j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}.
\end{equation}

Ensures we enter each city at most once.

\pause
\begin{equation}
\sum_{t=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{ijt} \ge 1 \mbox{ for all } i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}.
\end{equation}

Ensures we leave each city at most once.\\
\pause

\textbf{What's the problem?}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
Problem 1: Doesn't prevent cycles!
\begin{itemize}
    \item Flight 1: BOS to NYC
    \item Flight 2: NYC to BOS 
    \item Flight 3: SEA to SFO 
    \item Flight 4: SFO to SEA
\end{itemize}
\pause
Problem 2: Doesn't prevent logistical impossibilities!
\begin{itemize}
    \item Flight 1 on June 2: BOS to NYC
    \item Flight 2 on June 5: SEA to BOS
    \item Flight 3 on June 8: NYC to SEA
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\section{Implementation and Results}

\subsection{Implementation}

\begin{frame}
Our implementation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We have a client where users can input a flight request (designed for ``ignorant masses'')
    \pause
    \item We have a master server that takes in user input and distributes requests to slaves
    \pause
    \item Each slave server is a web crawler that crawls \textbf{Matrix Airfare Search} to obtain prices
    \pause
    \item Once all prices are known, then the master server uses \textbf{Balas' Additive Algorithm} to solve binary IP problem. Basic idea:
    depth-first search of all possible variable assignments with pruning and look-aheads to avoid searching impossible solutions.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
Let's do a five city, six day demonstration! The request:
\begin{center}
{\large 06/20/2014 06/25/2014 ATL ORD LAX MIA DFW}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Results and Thoughts}

\begin{frame}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In general, our solutions work. We have never found an incorrect or suboptimal route by looking at other combinations.
    \item Five city, six day example expands around 2 million nodes, much smaller than the full $2^{120}$ set of possible vectors.
    \item Biggest limiting factor is still Balas' algorithm (might be able to distribute)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
Future work:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Distribute Balas' algorithm or use heuristics (e.g., automatically eliminate some flights earlier)
    \item Evaluate speed and practical usefulness in more detail
    \item Expand to get multiple flights for one ticket
    \item Make a front-end website for the ignorant masses
    \item Polish paper: 8 pages overview, 14 pages of dense details
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
